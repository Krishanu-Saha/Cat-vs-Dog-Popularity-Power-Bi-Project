# Cat-vs-Dog-Popularity-Power-Bi-Project
Introduction:
The "Exploring Pet Ownership in the US" Power BI project aims to delve into the dynamics of pet ownership preferences across the United States. By analyzing data on pet ownership percentages, average numbers of cats and dogs per household, and geographic distribution, this project seeks to provide valuable insights into the popularity and trends of pet ownership in different regions of the country.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to understand and uncover patterns and trends related to pet ownership in the United States. By examining data on pet ownership percentages, the average number of cats and dogs per household, and geographic distribution, we aim to answer questions such as:

What is the overall percentage of households that own pets, cats, and dogs in the US?
How does the preference for cats versus dogs vary across different regions?
What is the average number of cats and dogs per household in the US?
Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in pet ownership based on geographic distribution?
Approach:
To achieve the project's objectives, we employed Power BI, a powerful data visualization and analytics tool. We started by analyzing a comprehensive dataset on pet ownership in the United States. This dataset provided information on pet ownership percentages, average numbers of cats and dogs per household, and geographical location data.

Using Power BI's interactive features, we created visualizations such as geolocation maps, horizontal bar charts, and pie charts. These visualizations allow for easy exploration of the data and enable us to present our findings in a clear and concise manner.

Conclusion:
Through this Power BI project, we have gained valuable insights into pet ownership patterns in the United States. The analysis of pet ownership percentages revealed an average of 56.86% of households owning pets, with cats accounting for 31.46% and dogs for 36.97%. Furthermore, the average number of cats per household was found to be 2.04, while the average number of dogs per household was 1.59.

Geolocation maps provided a visual representation of the distribution of pet-owning households across different regions. The horizontal bar charts highlighted the percentage of dog owners versus cat owners, allowing for comparisons between locations. Additionally, the pie chart showcased the total number of dogs and cats, illustrating the relative popularity of these pets.

This project has shed light on the preferences and trends in pet ownership, enabling a better understanding of pet ownership dynamics in the United States. The insights gained from this project can be utilized by various stakeholders, including pet industry professionals, policymakers, and researchers, to make informed decisions and develop targeted strategies related to pet ownership and associated industries.
